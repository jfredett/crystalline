1.1.0:
	Implemented Generators for various files:
		- Rakefile - includes crystalline tasks and bundler/setup
		- spec_helper - includes crystalline spec_helper/helper macros, and
		- travis - creates a standard .travis.yml file that tests all major ruby
							 versions >1.9 (including JRuby and Rubinius)
		- README - creates a standard boilerplate README.md that includes badge
							 links for common services (travis, coveralls, codeclimate, and
							 gem version from fury)

	Basic functionality -- include 'crystalline/spec' in your spec_helper, include
		'crystalline/rake' in your rake file. Receive useful stuff.
